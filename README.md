![lang_icon.png](lang_icon.png)

This project presents the **`TH language`**, which was developed for educational purposes.  
Each file contains part of the implementation of this language.  

A lexer and a parser are created that understand the entire grammar of this language, and  
a translator and interpreter are created that can handle arithmetic operations and assignment operation.
